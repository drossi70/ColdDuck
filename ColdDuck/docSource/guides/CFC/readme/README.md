# SuperBlog Sample CFCs
For your convenience I have included the sample SupeBlog CFC source code files that were used to create the SuperBlog documentation. They are included in your ColdDuck package (/ColdDuck/samples/SuperBlogCFC) but I thought it would be helpful to display them here so you can refer to them before you install ColdDuck.
