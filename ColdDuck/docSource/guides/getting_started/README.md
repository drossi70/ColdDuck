# Getting Started

For your first ColdFusion to JSDuck experience we will use the SuperBlog CF sample app that came with your ColdDuck download. This app is *not functional* - it is simply a few small CFC files to play with. 

The files are here:
	/ColdDuck/samples/SuperBlogCFC
	
This page assumes you have completed all the steps on the [Setup ColdDuck](../docs/#!/guide/setup) page.

## Creating documentation for the SuperBlog sample application:
To test the system we will create JSDuck documentation for the SuperBlog sample app as follows.

## First, turn the CFC files into the JS pseudoApp
See this page for details: [Creating the pseudoApp](../docs/#!/guide/creating_pseudoapp)

## Second, turn the JS pseudoApp into a JSDuck documentation site
See this page for details: [Creating the documentation](../docs/#!/guide/creating_jsduck)

## Next...
See this page for a few [tips about ColdFusion for documentation](../docs/#!/guide/cfcoding)
See the [FAQ](../docs/#!/guide/faq)
