# ColdDuck

Beta v0.1

... beautiful documentation for your ColdFusion classes by leveraging [ColdDoc](https://github.com/markmandel/ColdDoc) and [JSDuck](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck). 

## Installation
1. Unzip / copy the /ColdDuck folder and contents into your ColdFusion webroot (or a sub folder)
1. Point your web browser at /ColdDuck/docs for the documentation

I hope you find this useful and fun. Perhaps you might like to improve it?

Thanks,
Murray
